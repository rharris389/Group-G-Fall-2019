This project is attempting to create an Android calendar app that can automate a user's schedule. <br>
Events can be generated with a simple wizard. Upon creation, the events are scheduled within a user's free time.

##Current Items that Need to Be Addressed:
Layout/Design of Forms


## Future Work
If given enough time, we would like to add friends to the app. Users could add friends and schedule group events that would find free time between all parties. The event would be scheduled at a time that works with everyone.

Testing Environment Tips(Windows10):
1. start local python environment from command prompt, path will look something like: ##Envs\activate\Scripts\activate.bat
2. navigate to location of API files, it will look something like: cd C:\Users\MyUsername\Desktop\Group-G-Fall-2019-master\Group-G-Fall-2019-master\API\EarlyBirdApi
3. if starting for the first time instal requirements for the environment: ##pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start the server in the evironment with the following command: python manage.py runserver 8080

I am using port 8080 right now for testing, I am having issues with port 8000, seems it is being hogged by windows, if anyone else if having problems please let me know and I will try to help where I can.
