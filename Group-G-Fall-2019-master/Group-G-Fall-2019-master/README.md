This project is attempting to create an Android calendar app that can automate a user's schedule. <br>
Events can be generated with a simple wizard. Upon creation, the events are scheduled within a user's free time.

## Future Work
If given enough time, we would like to add friends to the app. Users could add friends and schedule group events that would find free time between all parties. The event would be scheduled at a time that works with everyone.
